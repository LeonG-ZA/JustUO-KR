JustUO-KR: UO Server Emulator based off JustUO. JustUO is based off the popular RunUO emulator. 

Changes to JustUO to support (KR)Kingdom Reborn Clients without breaking compatibility with the (EC/SA)Enhanced Client and the Classic Client.

- Supports UO:KR versions from 2.45.5.6 to 2.59.0.2 (I don't have 2.59.0.2 to confirm this. If anyone still has this version then let me know)
- Main testing is done with 2.53.0.2
